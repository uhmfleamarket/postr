# Project Description

Many college campuses have a very active second hand market, and UH Manoa is no exception. College students try to stretch their limited income by buying used goods and by selling things they no longer need. Previously, students used websites and apps such as Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and Letgo, but they are open to the general public which can lead to problems such as scams, robberies, and general inconvienence. Now, with our app they will have a place to trade with other UH Manoa students. Students can feel safe knowing they aren't dealing with an anonymous (and potentially criminal) stranger, and they can meet eachother between classes instead of trying to meet someone half way across town.

# The Team

## Austin Haigh
My goal for this project, apart from getting a good grade in this class, is mainly to finish another project that I can put on my resume. I'm best at backend development and have a few years of experience with Javascript. I hope to develop better team collaboration skills during this project.

## Jiayu Xu
My goal for this project is to have fun and create something that is interesting and useful. I want to apply the skills I learned so far in 311 into creating something amazing. I want the finished product to be attractive and easy to use. Payment system should be seamless and effective. Ebay, Craigslist, Letgo, is kind of ugly and complicated. The goal is to link sellers and vendors together hasslefree.I also want to create a effective escrow/ payment system to enable this. In general e-commerce is kind of clunky. We want to make peer to peer commerce more attractive. We want vendors and buyers to be ranked based on their performance.

## Zero Wu
My personal goal for this project is to have to get more experience on application creation. I find these experiences to be very useful in the field and it a good presentation to shows what I have work on and skill. Making selling produce page have become a very common in the modern day, it will be useful when I want to create my own product page in the future.

## William Cole
My personal goal for this project is to gain confidence building an application, and feel more confident as a "software developer".

## Davon Moss
My goal for this project is to experience working with a team to reach a finished product, so that I can bring that knowledge to the job market. I am mostly interested in developing the front-end of the application, and ensuring that our app is well desined and intuitive. I hope to learn more from my teammates about back-end and database design. 

# Big Picture Vision
Hopefully, tradr will become a useful and convenient tool for students looking to optimize their college experience. Tradr could even be extended past the UHM campus and become an application that is implemented across multiple campuses nationwide.
