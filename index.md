# Project Description

Many college campuses have a very active second hand market, and UH Manoa is no exception. College students try to stretch their limited income by buying used goods and by selling things they no longer need. Previously, students used websites and apps such as Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and Letgo, but they are open to the general public which can lead to problems such as scams, robberies, and general inconvienence. Now, with our app they will have a place to trade with other UH Manoa students. Students can feel safe knowing they aren't dealing with an anonymous (and potentially criminal) stranger, and they can meet eachother between classes instead of trying to meet someone half way across town.

My goal for this project is to experience working with a team to reach a finished product, so that I can bring that knowledge to the job market. I am mostly interested in developing the front-end of the application, and ensuring that our app is well desined and intuitive. I hope to learn more from my teammates about back-end and database design. 

# Big Picture Vision
Hopefully, tradr will become a useful and convenient tool for students looking to optimize their college experience. Tradr could even be extended past the UHM campus and become an application that is implemented across multiple campuses nationwide.
